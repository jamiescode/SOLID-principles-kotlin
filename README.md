# SOLID principles in Kotlin
Examples of SOLID principles in Kotlin

## Single Responsibility
* Entities should only have one reason to change

[View example](src/1-single-responsibility.kt)

## Open Closed Principle
* Entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification

[View example](src/2-open-closed-principle.kt)

## Liskov Substitution Principle
* Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes

[View example](src/3-liskov-substitution-principle.kt)

## Interface Segregation Principle
* Clients should not be forced to program against interfaces they do not use

[View example](src/4-interface-segregation-principle.kt)

## Dependency Inversion Principle
* Program to an interface, not an implementation

[View example](src/5-dependency-inversion-principle.kt)
